# Drowsiness Detection System

A real-time drowsiness detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This application captures video from a webcam, processes each frame to predict the driver's drowsiness level, and sounds an alert if drowsiness is detected.

## Features

- Real-time video capture and processing using OpenCV
- Drowsiness detection with a CNN model
- Alert system using sound notifications
- Visual feedback on the drowsiness score displayed on the video feed

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- Pygame
- torchvision
- PIL (Pillow)
- NumPy
